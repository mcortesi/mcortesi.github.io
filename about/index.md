I'm Mariano (aka. Cono), a software engineer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a professional, I've worked in
Hexacta in my younger years, and later I co-founded [Zauber](http://www.zauberlabs.com), a software boutique
where we worked on many internet projects from Argentina and the US. Back in 2011, we started
[Flowics](http://www.flowics.com) as product inside Zauber, and nowadays we shifted from software consulting
to a product base company (now named Flowics). I've enjoyed all the way that led me here, I was able to lead
many people, teach them, and also hang out with them. I've learned a lot, and continue doing so.

In software I seek beauty. I've once read that beauty can not only be found (and pursued) in arts, but in
anything you do. You can find beauty on the design of a bridge, in mathematics, and of course in software.
I found beauty in clean design, on simplicity, on using a functional programming style.

It was a long time ago, I was much younger than today, and worked on another company. The guy in charge of
software methodology for the company was talking about the new templates for all different kind of documents, and while doing so he mentions that with that his trying to erradicate the "Blank Page Fear". I didn't know the concept back then, but surely I could relate to it, and that concept stayed with me as this really true and deep concept.

It's true, it doesn't matter if it's a book, an essay, a software program, a presentation, whenever we stand with an empty document, there this fear we feel. The fear of what to do next, what to do first, where to go first. There is no structure, no empty places to fill, just a unexpressive white page. For me, it's always the hardest part.

For me, starting means too many decisions. Am I starting a blog? What will I write about? Is jekyll alrigth as a template engine? How does it work? Is this blog template ok? Should I change it? Which photo should I use as the article's header? I know that it doesn't happen to all the people, many people think less or think later, and start sooner. That's wiser. You start, and then you ask. You can always change things later (well, not always depends on what you are doing :) ).

So, this is my first post, of my first blog. I don't yet what I'll be writing about. About programming, that's for sure. About functional programming in many cases, since a I love it. I chose a photo for this post, but then I had to crop it, and there is this question bugging me... is the height ok? should i use the same aspect ratio in all posts? what does medium does?... Again, too many questions.

What I DO KNOW is that I've read too many books, too many articles and attended to too many talks in which I felt that I've learnt in one hour, what I could have learnt in 5 minutes; and I want not to produce the same effect. I value conciseness, and I believe I should target an audience and be clear about that. You can't write a post for beginners and advance students, if you one will get lost and the other will get bored.

Some book authors love to explain concepts several times, sometimes you read the first chapters and the rest is just a lot of pages trying to explain what you've already got in the first chapters.

With talks is different, you probably attend to one because the title is really interesting, and you said to yourself "great! I'm going to learn about react!", but by the end of the talk you realize that you could have learnt the same thing if you've just read the introductory article they provide, and a little more. Or if you already read that article you end up thinking that the whole talk could have been reduced to that two slides that were different to the introductory article.

With articles, there is a lot of things that can happen. Most articles are written as introductions to some subject; and when you want to learn about that subject you end up reading a lot of introductions about the same subject. Want to read about ES6 collections? You'll find a lot of articles, very similar, but different, which should you read? All? Some? one? which? Sometimes you read tutorials, that take you to several steps to setup the environment, do the hello world, and stop there. Really?

Enough ranting! Dealing with an audience is a hard thing, specially when you don't know the audience and you can't see it. For me it's important be aware there is a audience, and try to image at least how are you talking to, and be clear about it. "Hey this article is not for newbies!" Let's see how well I fare on this! Wish me luck!

Good bye blank page! You're dead now!
